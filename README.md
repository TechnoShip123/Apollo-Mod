# ExampleMod
A testing mod created by TechnoShip123 (me)

As of 12/12/2020 this mod is running on Minecraft: v1.15.2

How to add the mod


1. Make sure you have already installed Minecraft Forge.

2. Download a Forge compatible mod from this site, or anywhere else!

3. Open Minecraft, click the ‘Mods’ button on the main menu, then click ‘Open Mods Folder’.

Important: Some older versions of Forge may not have the ‘Open Mods Folder’ button. If that is the case, you need to find the folder manually.

Windows:

Press the Windows key and R at the same time
Type %appdata% and press enter
Find the Minecraft folder and then look for the Mods folder within that
Mac:

Click on the desktop and then press Command+Shift+G all at the same time
Type ~/Library and press enter
Open the folder Application Support and then Minecraft
4. Place the mod you have just downloaded (.jar or .zip file) into the Mods folder.

Relaunch Minecraft, and you should now see the mod you have installed in the list! :D
